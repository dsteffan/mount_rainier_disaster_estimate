  Description:
    Abstract:
      Mount Rainier is a dormant volcano that is the highest peak in the Cascade Range and carries a larger load of glacier ice than any other mountain in the contiguous U.S.  The mountain's large ice mass and great topographic relief pose geologic hazards during both future eruptions and time periods without eruptive activity.   GIS data layers case 1, case 2, and case 3 were delineated by scientists at the Cascade Volcano Observatory and depict various lahar innundation zones around the mountain.   The lahar hazards were defined by field investigations and construction of cross sections.  For examples and descriptions of field investigations and cross section construction, see Scott and Vallance (1995) and Scott and others, (1995).   Two additional GIS layers were created that show post-lahar sedimentation and pyroclastic flow zones.  These coverages are titled postlahar and pyroclastic.

    Purpose:
      These volcanic hazard zones are intended for use by public and private
      agencies to view, overlay with other Geographic Information System (GIS) data
      sets, and make maps of volcanic hazards from potential future eruptions of
      Mount Rainier, Washington.  It is critical to understand the nature of the boundaries
      of the volcanic hazard zones.  Although arcs serve as boundaries of hazard
      zones, the degree of hazard does not change abruptly at these boundaries.
      Rather, a volcanic hazard decreases gradually with increased distance from
      the volcano and above the valley floor.  These volcanic hazards also span a
      range of size and recurrence.  The hazard zones delineated in this data set
      portray volcanic events believed most likely from future activity at Mount
      Rainier, Washington.  Areas outside the hazard zones, especially those having low
      relief, should not be regarded as hazard-free.  Too many uncertainties exist
      in source, size, and mobility of future events to locate boundaries of
      zero-hazard zones with confidence.

  Use_Constraints:
    Although digital data is easy to view at nearly any scale or projection, each
    vector data set has a compilation scale that determines the accuracy and
    reliable use of the data set.  The vectors in this data set were compiled and
    checked for accuracy at a scale of 1:100,000 and thereby should only be used
    at 1:100,000 or smaller scales.  The data set is inappropriate for use at
    scales larger than 1:100,000.  Doing so will produce inaccurate and
    unreliable results.

      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
        Original linework were compiled on mylar greenlines of U.S. Geological
        Survey topographic quadrangles created according to National Map
        Accuracy Standards.  Digitized linework were plotted, registered to
        original linework, and inspected visually for discrepency of greater
        than a linewidth (approximately 0.007 inches).  For computer modelling,
        Digital Elevation Models having cell sizes of about 62 ground meters or
        about 2 millimeters on the map at 1:100,000 scale were derived from Digital
        Line Graph contour layers that were created according to National Map
        Accuracy Standards.  All linework was plotted with DLG contour layers
        to check for positional accuracy as are reasonable according to  geologic
        and hydrologic principles.
    Vertical_Positional_Accuracy:
      Vertical_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
        1:100,000 scale Digital Line Graph (DLG) contours have contour intervals of
        either 50 or 40 meters as well as Digital Elevation Models have vertical
        accuracies according to the National Map Accuracy Standards.  All linework
        was plotted with DLG contour layers to check for positional accuracy
        as are reasonable according to geologic and hydrologic principles.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        Linework was captured by hand digitizing.
        Digitizing procedures: Arcs were digitized in tablet inches from lines inked on
        1:24,000 or 1:100,000 scale topographic mylar greenlines.  Each quadrangle was
        registered to the digitizer and re-registered to ensure that tics could be
        relocated with an RMS equal to or less than 0.004.  Lines were digitized using
        a NODESNAP CLOSEST .05 and a weed tolerance of 0.  A second coverage was
        CREATEd from the first.  In INFO, the tics were changed from inch coordinates
        to decimal degree coordinates and saved.  The decimal degree coordinate
        coverage was converted to a UTM projection using:
        INPUT
        PROJECTION GEOGRAPHIC
        UNITS DD
        PARAMETERS
        OUTPUT
        PROJECTION UTM
        UNITS METERS
        ZONE 10
        PARAMETERS
        END
        Each coverage in inches was TRANSFORMed to the empty UTM coverage ensuring
        the transformation RMS was equal or less than 0.004 inches.  The individual
        coverages were edgematched and merged into a single coverage.  Coverages
        were checked for digitizing accuracy both before and after merging by
        plotting linework at 1:24,000 or 1:100,000 scale as appropriate and
        overlain on original linework.

      POSTLAHAR.AAT - Arc Attribute Table
      The attributes FID, Shape, FNODE#, TNODE#, LPOLY#, RPOLY#, LENGTH, POSTLAHAR#, POSTLAHAR-ID, AREA, and PERIMETER are created and maintained automatically for internal use by Arc/INFO software.

      RNR1NORTH_  and RNR1NORTH1 are both defined as having widths of 8 and outputs of 9.
      These attributes are essentially identical.  Each has the values of 1 and 2 that identify the boundary lines of the hazard zone along the Green and Duwamish Rivers.  This area is at reduced risk of a case1 lahar and at significant risk of a case2 lahar or of post-lahar sedimentation (as described in the completeness report) .
      2         shows the area of Harbor Island in Elliot Bay, Seattle, that is in the designated hazard zone.
      1         shows the rest of the hazard zone that extends from Harbor Island down to Auburn.

      SYMBOL is defined as having a width of 4 and an output of 3.
      This attribute represents the same lines of the hazard zone as that of RNR1NORTH_ and RNR1NORTH1, but with a single value of 1.  Harbor Island is not given its own value.

Distribution_Information:
  Resource_Description: Downloadable Data
  Distribution_Liability:
    This dataset has not been approved for release or publication by the Director of the USGS. The USGS reserves the right to revise the data pursuant to further analysis and review. Furthermore, it is released on condition that neither the USGS nor the United States Government may be held liable for any damages resulting from its authorized or unauthorized use. Any use of trade, product, or firm names is for descriptive purposes only and does not imply endorsement by the U.S. Government.
    Distribution of the database files assumes that all components of the database will be used together. Use of any one ArcInfo coverage outside the context of the other coverages is considered inappropriate or misuse. Due to the uncertainty involved in the prediction of lahar-inundation limits, individual coverages do not delimit a well-defined range of hazard. The collective group of the ArcInfo coverages better convey the gradational nature of hazard zones.
